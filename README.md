#  ABSTRACT
Analyzing the relationship between age of death for region and gender, and predicting future birth and mortality rates by region , also to frame the current mortality table

# OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
 Statistical methods involved in carrying out a study include planning , designing, collecting data analysis gives meaning to the meaningless numbers, there by breathing life into a lifeless data. The results and inference are precise only if proper statistical test are used, understanding the quantitative and qualitative with parametric and non parametric test used for data analysis.
- To Compare the relationship between Gender , region with age of death
- To estimate the probability of mortality rate
- To estimate birth rate by region-wise
- To predict & study about the rapid increase in no. of . live birth

# CONCLUSION:
The relationship between region and age of death of a person is evident in various studies and demographics. It has been observed that certain regions have higher average ages of death compared to others. Similarly, the gender of a person also plays a role in determining the age of death. Statistics and research suggest that there are differences in life expectancy between males and females.

Looking specifically at the year 2027, the probability of a person dying under the age of 59 has been estimated to be 0.3674. This
statistics indicates the risk associated with premature deaths before reaching this age threshold.
Furthermore, when examining the birth rates in different areas, it is projected that urban areas will experience a birth rate of
11.07% in 2027. In rural areas, the birth rate is anticipated to be 17.04% while other regions will have a birth rate of 19.59%.
Combining these figures, the overall birth rate for 2027 is projected to be 16.02%

Interestingly, there is an anticipated increase of 12.05% in the number of live births by 2027 when compared to 2020. This growth signifies a potential rise in population in the coming years, indicating various factors such as improvements in healthcare, changes in socio-economic conditions, and advancements in maternal and child health.

In summary, analysing the relationship between factors such as region, gender ,age of death and birth rates can provide valuable
insights into population dynamics and trends. By examining these statistics, researchers and policymakers can better understand the demographic changes that may occur in the future.
